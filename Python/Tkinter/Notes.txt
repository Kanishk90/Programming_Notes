I'm sharing my honest feedback about the faculties, namely Arpit, Manish, and Rahul, at the CAD Institute. Within a span of 1.5 months, they charged Rs 6500. Here's the breakdown:

HTML Course (4 days): Rs 2000
CSS Course (15 days): Rs 2500
JavaScript Course (15 days): Rs 2000
The problem? Well, the faculties, unfortunately, lacked programming experience. It felt like they were stuck and didn't provide the kind of insight one expects. Honestly, you could probably learn better from the vast sea of resources available on the internet.

In the end, I wouldn't recommend this institute even to my worst enemy. The amount spent didn't match the value received, and the lack of experienced faculty was a major letdown. Save your money and find better alternatives online. ðŸš«
